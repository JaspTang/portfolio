                &emsp; I am a 15 year old boy current going through high school. Over the past years, I have inhabited a liking for coding... and computers for that matter. I have a strong interest in both hardware and software. I have built a computer before and taken apart several. Furthering my passion in hardware, I have familiarized myself with Arduinos and compatable modules. Over the past few years, I have been learning a various coding languages, beginning with python. I have used these languages for multiple applications, such as app development, web development, and database development. As a whole, although, I am most intrigued by how both the hardware and software communicate with each other to create a functional and powerful computer.

            <!--<br>&emsp; I enjoy observing how, not only computers, but also other technology / engineering masterpieces work, such as keyboards, mice, and airplanes. In fact, I also have a passion in the aerodynamics of airplanes and rockets. One last strong interest of mine is photography. I love taking nature and action photos. In fact, I used to take action photos of my brother at his tournaments! However, my interest in computers has prevailed over the others. Due to this, I always look to develop new projects, such as this website! -->
